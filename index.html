      Hi, I’m Aliakbar Rzazada. My interest in computer science comes from mathematics and logic, which strongly influence how I approach problems. I see coding as a tool for structured and careful problem-solving, with a main focus on competitive programming. I enjoy designing efficient algorithms and breaking complex logical challenges into clean, well-organized code.

      At the moment, I am learning low-level programming to better understand how computers work. I am exploring system architecture and memory management to gain deeper insight into how software interacts with hardware at a fundamental level. My goal is to build reliable systems with a strong internal design, not just applications that work on the surface.
